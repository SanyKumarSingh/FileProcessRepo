################################ HyperSQL Database (HSQLDB) ##############################
#
# Each HSQLDB is called a catalog. There are three types of catalog depending on how the data is stored.
# mem: stored entirely in RAM. file: stored in file system. res: stored in a Java resource, such as a Jar or Zip and are always read-only.
#
# A file catalog consists 2 – 6 files, all named same as the <database-name> but with different extensions. All these files are essential and should never be deleted. 
# <database-name>.properties – 	Contains settings about the database.
# <database-name>.script – 		Contains definitions for tables and other database objects plus data for non-cached tables.
# <database-name>.log – 		Contains recent changes made to the data. Log is removed when database shutdown normally. For abnormal shutdown, it is used to redo the changes in the next startup.
# <database-name>.data – 		Contains the data for cached tables.
# <database-name>.backup – 		It is used to revert to the last known consistent state of the data file.
# <database-name>.lck - 		Used to lock the database.
#
# When the database engine shutdown, it creates temporary files with the extension .new. These files should not be deleted by the user. 
# During next startup, all such files will be renamed as above or deleted by the database engine. 
# In some circumstances, <database-name>.data.xxx.old is created and deleted afterwards by the database engine. The user can delete these testdb.data.xxx.old files.
#
# HSQLDB is supported by spring-boot-starter-parent by 2.0.0.RELEASE
# In this Project used hsql_cfg.xml to load HSQLDB configuration on Application Server startup by importing the xml file in Application.java
